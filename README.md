# OctoAgent

🐙 My personal playground for exploring agentic AI concepts by attempting to tackle GitHub issues. Strictly for learning and experimentation, not for serious bug squashing... yet!

## TODO

- [ ] Add more agentic features (e.g., handoffs)
- [ ] Split code into multiple files
- [ ] Improve logic to automatically determine target files
