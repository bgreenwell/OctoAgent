Of course. That's a critical clarification to make for anyone using the tool. Clear documentation prevents confusion and errors.

Here is the updated content for your `README.md`. I've revised the "Environment Variables" and "Arguments" sections to explain the relationship between the token and the user ID.

My personal playground for exploring agentic AI concepts by attempting to tackle GitHub issues. This project uses a team of AI agents, powered by the OpenAI Python SDK, to triage, propose, review, and commit solutions for GitHub issues.

**Disclaimer:** This is strictly for learning and experimentation, not for serious bug squashing... yet!

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into a Python package within the `src` directory for better modularity and maintainability.

```

* `agents.py`: Defines the different AI agents, such as `IssueTriagerAgent`, `CodeProposerAgent`, `CodeReviewerAgent`, and `CodeCommitterAgent`.
* `github_client.py`: A dedicated client for making requests to the GitHub REST API, handling tasks like fetching issues, creating branches, and committing files.
* `tools.py`: Contains the functions that agents can use (e.g., `download_github_issue`, `commit_code_to_branch`) and helper utilities.
* `main.py`: The main entry point for the application. It handles command-line argument parsing and orchestrates the agent workflow.

## Required Setup

### 1. Dependencies
First, clone the repository and install the necessary Python dependencies. (It is recommended to do this in a virtual environment).

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/bgreenwell/octoagent.git](https://github.com/bgreenwell/octoagent.git)
cd octoagent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Environment Variables
This application requires API keys for both OpenAI and GitHub to function. These should be stored as environment variables.

* **`OPENAI_API_KEY`**: Your API key from OpenAI to power the agents.
* **`GITHUB_TOKEN`**: A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT). This token must have `repo` scope and belong to a GitHub account that has push access to the target repository (specified via the `user_id` and `repo_name` arguments).

You can set them in your shell like this:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_personal_access_token"
```

## How to Run

The application is run from the command line, specifying the repository, issue number, and the target file for the fix.

### Command Structure
```bash
python -m src.octoagent.main <repo_name> <issue_number> <target_file> [--user_id <github_user_or_org>]
```

### Arguments
* `repo_name`: The name of the repository.
* `issue_number`: The number of the issue you want to solve.
* `target_file`: The full path to the file within the repository that should be modified.
* `--user_id` (optional): The GitHub username or organization that owns the repository. The provided `GITHUB_TOKEN` must have permissions for this user/organization's repository. **Defaults to `bgreenwell`**.

### Examples

1.  **Run on an issue in the default `bgreenwell` account:**
    The following command attempts to solve issue #12 in the `bgreenwell/statlingua` repository by modifying the `R/explain.R` file.

    ```bash
    python -m src.octoagent.main statlingua 12 R/explain.R
    ```

2.  **Run on an issue in another user's repository:**
    To target a repository under a different user or organization, use the `--user_id` flag.

    ```bash
    python -m src.octoagent.main some-awesome-repo 42 src/app/main.py --user_id another-developer
    ```

## TODO

- [ ] Add more agentic features (e.g., handoffs)
- [ ] Improve logic to automatically determine target files
- [ ] Add robust error handling and retries for API calls
- [ ] Create a more sophisticated review and revision loop
