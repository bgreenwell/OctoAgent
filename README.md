# OctoAgent

üêô My personal playground for exploring agentic AI concepts by attempting to tackle GitHub issues. Strictly for learning and experimentation, not for serious bug squashing... yet!

## Example Usage

Assumes you have an OpenAI API key and GitHub PAT stored in the environment variables `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`, respectively. Modify `main_test_flow()` in `main/py` to point to a relevant issue and file. Then, within the main directory, run: 
```bash
python -m main
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add more agentic features (e.g., handoffs)
- [ ] Split code into multiple files
- [ ] Improve logic to automatically determine target files
